<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. - Done

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I’m **Adyasha Patra**, a Master’s student in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/), specializing in AI/ML, with a strong focus on LLM reasoning, agentic systems, NLP, and speech models. I previously earned my B.Tech in Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), graduating with honors and a minor in AI & Data Science.

My research lies at the intersection of **reasoning efficiency, formal mathematics, and language understanding**. At UCSD, I work with the [Rose-STL Lab](https://roselab1.ucsd.edu/) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI models in mathematics by bridging formal proof systems with informal reasoning, using process-level reward models. Earlier, my work in speech and multilingual NLP led to results accepted at [EACL 2026](https://www.eacl.org/2026/), spanning **code-switched speech recognition**, **dysarthric ASR**, and **cross-lingual transfer learning**.

Beyond research, I enjoy building real-world systems. I’ve worked on **agentic RAG architectures**, **LLM security analysis**, and **autonomous data engineering agents**, and have industry experience at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) and [Prodigal (YC W18)](https://www.prodigal.ai/). I’m particularly excited about designing **scalable, interpretable, and reasoning-capable AI systems** that move beyond surface-level generation toward deeper intelligence.
